Anybody Seen My Baby
The Rolling Stones
She confessed her love to me
Then she vanished on the breeze
Trying to hold on to that was just impossible
She was more than beautiful
Closer to ethereal
With a kind of down to earth flavor
Close my eyes
It's three in the afternoon
Then I realize
That she's really gone for good
Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
Love has gone and made me blind
I've looked but I just can't find
She has gotten lost in the crowd
And I was flippin' magazines
In that place on Mercer street
When I thought I spotted her
And getting on a motor bike
Looking really lady like
Didn't she just give me a wave?
Salty tears
It's three in the afternoon
Has she disappeared
Has she really gone for good
Anybody seen my baby
Anybody seen her around
If I just close my eyes
I reach out and touchâ€¦
